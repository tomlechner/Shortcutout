Shortcutout
===========


This program lets you edit various shortcut files by dragging and dropping
actions to their keys. Also allows exporting a somewhat nice looking list
of shortcuts, or a keyboard representation.

One export format is for Waldo Bronchart's great html Shortcut Mapper.
See [http://waldobronchart.github.io/ShortcutMapper](here) for Waldo's browser in
action.

Supported formats in addition to Shortcut Mapper, are Gimp, Inkscape,
Krita, Scribus, and Laidout.
